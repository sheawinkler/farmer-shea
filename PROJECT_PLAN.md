# Project Plan

This document outlines the project plan for the `farmer-shea` project.

## Phase 1: Initial Implementation (Completed)

- [x] Implement wallet functionality for Solana.
- [x] Implement a Solana client for interacting with the blockchain.
- [x] Implement a simple farming strategy for Solend.
- [x] Implement a Pyth oracle for getting asset prices.
- [x] Implement a simple execution engine.

## Phase 2: Multi-Network Expansion (Completed)

- [x] Implement a client for the Hyperliquid network.
- [x] Implement a client for the Base network.
- [x] Develop placeholder farming strategies for Hyperliquid and Base.
- [x] Integrate the new clients and strategies into the main application loop.

## Phase 3: Advanced Strategy Implementation (Completed)

- [x] Implement a functional vault deposit strategy for Hyperliquid.
- [x] Implement a functional yield farming strategy for a Base protocol (e.g., Uniswap V3).
- [x] Refactor the execution engine to handle more complex, multi-step strategies.
- [x] Improve the oracle system to support price feeds from multiple sources.

## Phase 4: Refinement & Usability (Completed)

- [x] Enhance the terminal UI to provide more detailed information about portfolio, PnL, and strategy performance.
- [x] Implement a configuration file for managing strategies, wallet paths, and other settings.
- [x] Add more robust error handling and retry logic to the execution engine.
- [x] Improve logging with more structured data.

## Phase 5: Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add support for more farming strategies on Solana.
- [ ] Add support for more networks (e.g., Arbitrum, Optimism).
- [ ] Implement advanced risk management features.
- [ ] Develop a more sophisticated strategy management system.
- [ ] Explore integration with external analytics platforms.
